                            <strong>Mary Wilson, The Supremes:</strong>
                            <p>"Mickey is one of the people God gave the gift of doing your 'best' with the gifts God has given you."</p>

                            <strong>Smokey Robinson, Motown Artists, Song Writer, Producer:</strong>
                            <p>"Mickey Stevenson is my brother, brother. He has not received his props. He was our first A&R man at Motown. Really the first A&R man ever. Marvin Gaye wanted to be a crooner. Mickey was the one who turned Marvin around to become what we know and love! He convinced Marvin Gaye to sing rhythm and blues. Mickey has an eye and ears for talented people."</p>

                        <li>
                            <strong>Bishop Clarence Haddon, Pastor:</strong>
                            <p>"It's a great pleasure to speak about an acquaintance I have made in the past two years — a man whom has done so much for so many. I found Mickey Stevinson to be a truly a converted brother. He is a great spiritual man — and is interested in looking back at the roots of the fall of The Holy Ghost, the first fall in America.</p>
                            <p>I believe he will do a great job which will be a great benefit to so many who are not aware of the roots of Pentecost. He is a very sincere, spiritual, and a prayerful gentleman — especially coming from the background that he's coming from and with all his achievements. It had to be God with him and for him in order for him to achieve these goals in recent years.</p>
                            <p>I recommend him to anyone in the field, further than the Pulpit knows as outreach to witnessing to personal experience with the Creator God Almighty and I thank you for this opportunity to share my knowledge of this great man, Mickey Stevinson."</p>
